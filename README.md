The Universal Knowledge Agent is an intelligent knowledge discovery and synthesis system that automatically curates and summarizes relevant content from multiple sources, designed to enhance personal knowledge management workflows.

**Our mission** is to empower knowledge workers and researchers by creating an intelligent agent that seamlessly integrates external knowledge sources with personal knowledge management systems, automatically discovering and synthesizing relevant documentation, tutorials, and expert content to create dense, interconnected summaries that enhance personal knowledge graphs and accelerate learning.

## ✨ Key Features

It provides a number of features that make it easy to build comprehensive knowledge bases:

- 🔍 **Intelligent Content Discovery** - Automated curation from web sources, documentation, Reddit, and YouTube
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Synthesis** - Dense, actionable summaries using advanced language models
- 📝 **Universal Integration** - Seamless compatibility with Logseq, Obsidian, Notion, and markdown
- 🔗 **Knowledge Linking** - Automatic connection of new insights to existing knowledge graphs
- ⚡ **Productivity Focus** - Reduce research time for technical topics
- 🎯 **Contextual Intelligence** - Understand existing knowledge base to avoid redundancy
- 📚 **Quality over Quantity** - Curated high-quality sources with depth over breadth
- 🚀 **Real-time Processing** - Live content monitoring and intelligent caching
- ...and much more 💫

## 🤔 Why Universal Knowledge Agent?

Universal Knowledge Agent addresses the growing challenge of information overload that knowledge workers face daily. Instead of spending hours manually searching through documentation, tutorials, and forums, you can focus on what matters most - applying knowledge to solve real problems.

**🎯 Built for Modern Knowledge Workers**: Whether you're a developer exploring new frameworks, a researcher building comprehensive notes, or a product manager staying current with industry trends, Universal Knowledge Agent adapts to your workflow and amplifies your productivity.

**🔒 Privacy-First Approach**: Your knowledge remains yours. The agent works locally with your preferred tools (Logseq, Obsidian, Notion) while optionally leveraging AI services only when you choose to enable them.

**🧠 Intelligent, Not Overwhelming**: Rather than dumping raw information, the agent creates thoughtful, interconnected summaries that build upon your existing knowledge base, helping you develop deeper understanding over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start using Universal Knowledge Agent, follow these simple steps:

1. **[Download](https://github.com/vitaliy-ostapchuk93/knowledge-agent/releases/latest)** the latest release for your platform
2. **Install** the agent and launch the application
3. **Start discovering** knowledge ✨

That's it! You can now enjoy automated knowledge curation and synthesis. Have fun! 🎉

### 🛠️ Developer Installation

For developers who want to contribute or customize the agent:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vitaliy-ostapchuk93/knowledge-agent.git
cd knowledge-agent

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the interactive demo (no API keys required)
bun run demo
```

> **💡 Tip:** The demo showcases core functionality with mock data, creating a sample knowledge base in the `demo-knowledge-base` directory. For enhanced AI features, set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0.0 or higher (recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22+ (alternative runtime)
- Optional: [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key for enhanced AI features

### Quick Example

```typescript
import { KnowledgeAgent } from './src/core/knowledge-agent.js';

const agent = new KnowledgeAgent({
  platform: 'markdown',
  aiStrategy: 'openai', // or 'mock' for development
});

// Discover and synthesize knowledge on any topic
const result = await agent.processQuery('React Server Components');
console.log(result.summary);
```

## 💻 Development

```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows clean architecture principles with well-defined boundaries:

### Core Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern** - Pluggable content discovery and AI processing
2. **Adapter Pattern** - Platform-specific integrations (Markdown, Logseq, Obsidian, Notion)
3. **Observer Pattern** - Event-driven updates and notifications
4. **Facade Pattern** - Unified interface for complex operations
5. **Cache-Aside Pattern** - Intelligent caching for performance
