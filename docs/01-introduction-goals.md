## 1.2 Quality Goals

> **Note:** For the complete quality model with detailed quality trees, business relevance scores, and technical difficulty assessments, see [Quality Model](quality-model.md).

Based on our comprehensive quality analysis, the top 5 quality goals prioritized by business impact and technical feasibility are:

| Priority | Quality Goal               | Business Impact | Technical Difficulty | Key Scenario                                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | **Platform Adaptability**  | 5               | 5                    | Same research request works natively in Logseq, Obsidian, and Notion |
| 2        | **Functional Correctness** | 5               | 5                    | Search for "React hooks" returns accurate, current, relevant sources |
| 3        | **Time Behaviour**         | 5               | 4                    | Content discovery completes in <3 seconds across all platforms       |
| 4        | **Cross-Platform UX**      | 4               | 4                    | Consistent user experience that feels native on each platform        |
| 5        | **Interoperability**       | 4               | 4                    | Export research from Obsidian and import seamlessly into Logseq      |

### Quality Drivers

**Platform Adaptability** is the foundational capability - without seamless cross-platform support, the universal vision fails.

**Functional Correctness** drives user trust and adoption - inaccurate results would make the tool useless regardless of platform.

**Time Behaviour** maintains research flow state - slow responses break user momentum across all platforms.

**Cross-Platform UX** ensures adoption across diverse user bases - platform-specific optimization is critical for success.

**Interoperability** enables knowledge mobility - users often work across multiple platforms and need seamless data flow.
